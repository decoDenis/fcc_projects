    <!-- Step 4
    To tell browsers how to encode characters on your page, set the charset to utf-8. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages. -->

    <!-- Step 5
    Finally, use a viewport <meta> tag to make sure your page looks the same on all devices. -->

    <!-- Step 15
    When the shorthand margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and margin-left and margin-right to the second value. -->

    <!-- Step 21
    There are two main color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices, and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.
    In this project, you'll work with the RGB model. This means that colors begin as black, and change as different levels of red, green, and blue are introduced. An easy way to see this is with the CSS rgb function. -->

    <!-- Step 22
    A function is a piece of code that can take an input and perform a specific action. The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color:
        rgb(red, green, blue);
    Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color. -->

    <!-- Step 26
    In the additive RGB color model, primary colors are colors that, when combined, create pure white. But for this to happen, each color needs to be at its highest intensity. -->

    <!-- Step 31
    Now that you're familiar with secondary colors, you'll learn how to create tertiary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color. -->

    <!-- Step 34
    There are three more tertiary colors: chartreuse green (green + yellow), azure (blue + cyan), and rose (red + magenta). -->

    <!-- Step 36
    A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

    Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter. -->

    <!-- Step 46
    A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320. -->

    <!-- Step 47
    You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
    With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0). -->

    <!-- Step 48
    The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

    The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

    If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

    Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

    Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral. -->

    <!-- Step 49
    You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

    A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

    One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value. -->

    <!-- Step 50
    The linear-gradient function is very flexible -- here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial:

    linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
    gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. color1 and color2 are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, rgb, or hsl. -->

    <!-- Step 54
    Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.
    For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:
    linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black); -->

    <!-- Step 73
    Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.

    With the CSS opacity property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default. -->

    <!-- Step 74
    Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. Similar to the opacity property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is. -->

    <!-- Step 75
    You're already familiar with using the rgb function to set colors. To add an alpha channel to an rgb color, use the rgba function instead.
    The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0 to 1.0 for the alpha channel:
    rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue); -->

    <!-- Step 78
    The default display property for div elements is block. So when two block elements are next to each other, they stack like actual blocks. For example, your marker elements are all stacked on top of each other. -->

    <!-- Step 80
    Borders have several styles to choose from. You can make your border a solid line, but you can also use a dashed or dotted line if you prefer. Solid border lines are probably the most common. -->

    <!-- Step 82
    The border-left shorthand property lets you to set the left border's width, style, and color at the same time.

    Here is the syntax:
    border-left: width style color; -->

    <!-- Step 86
    The last thing you'll do is add a slight shadow to each marker to make them look even more realistic.

    The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:
    box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color; -->

    <!-- Step 88
    There is an optional blurRadius value for the box-shadow property:

        box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color;

    If a blurRadius value isn't included, it defaults to 0 and produces sharp edges. The higher the value of blurRadius, the greater the blurring effect is. -->

    <!-- Step 89
    To expand the shadow out further, You can do that with the optional spreadRadius value:

        box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;

    Like blurRadius, spreadRadius defaults to 0 if it isn't included. -->
