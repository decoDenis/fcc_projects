    <!-- Step 1
    As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page.
    Add the <!DOCTYPE html> tag, and an html element with a lang attribute of en. -->

    <!-- Step 12
    You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:

    element {
        property: value;
    } -->

    <!-- Step 13
    In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the h1 element. -->

    <!-- Step 14
    You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:

    selector1, selector2 {
        property: value;
    } -->

    <!-- Step 18
    For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
    Add the following within the head element:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> -->
        
    <!-- Step 21
    The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. -->
    
    <!-- Step 23
    Comments in CSS look like this:
    /* comment here */ -->

    <!-- Step 26
    Next, you want to center the div horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element.  -->

    <!-- Step 27
    So far you have been using type selectors to style elements. A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:

    .class-name {
        styles
    } -->

    <!-- step 37
    p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.

    To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements, so they behave more like inline elements. -->

    <!-- Step 40
    Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines in the code creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line. One way to fix this is to make each p element's width a little less than 50%. -->


    <!-- Step 60
    You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available. -->

    <!-- Step 67
    You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content. Note that hr elements are self closing. -->
    
    <!-- Step 71
    Notice how the thickness of the line looks bigger? The default value of a property named border-width is 1px for all edges of hr elements. By changing the border to the same color as the background, the total height of the line is 5px (3px plus the top and bottom border width of 1px). -->

    <!-- Step 80
    The default color of a link that has not yet been clicked on is typically blue. The default color of a link that has already been visited from a page is typically purple. -->

    <!-- Step 81
    You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }. -->

    <!-- Step 82
    You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }. -->

    <!-- Step 83
    You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }. -->

    <!-- Step 90
    The image you added is not centered horizontally like the Coffee heading above it. img elements are "like" inline elements. -->

    <!-- Step 92
    It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller. The h2 elements have default top and bottom margin space, so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.
    There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions. Negative values are created using a - in front of the value.  -->
