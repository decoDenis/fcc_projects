<!-- Step 3
In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.

Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element. -->

<!-- Step 4
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.

Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in. -->

<!-- Step 5
Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.

Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page. -->

<!-- Step 33
It's helpful to have your margins push in one direction. -->

<!-- Step 42
The border-radius property accepts up to four values to round the top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners. -->
