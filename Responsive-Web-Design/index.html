    <!-- Step 8
    HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). An example of an img element using an src attribute: <img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">. -->
    
    <!-- Step 9
    All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat. -->
    
    <!-- Step 22
    The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption. -->

    <!-- Step 42
    Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines. -->
    
    <!-- Step 44
    label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button. -->
    
    <!-- Step 45
    The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page. -->
    
    <!-- Step 47
    Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value. -->
    
    <!-- Step 48
    If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons. -->

    <!-- Step 49
    The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line. -->

    <!-- Step 50
    The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form. -->

    <!-- Step 53
    Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos. -->

    <!-- Step 55
    There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute. -->

    <!-- Step 59
    Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page. -->

    <!-- Step 60
    In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes. -->

    <!-- Step 66
    Notice that the entire contents of the page are nested within an html element. All other elements must be descendants of this html element.
    Add the lang attribute with the value en to the opening html tag to specify that the language of the page is English. -->

    <!-- Step 67
    All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
    Add this declaration as the first line of the code. -->
