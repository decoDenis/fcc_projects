<!-- Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.

Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.

The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers. -->

<!-- Step 4
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.

Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute. -->

<!-- Step 6
Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.

Add a header and a main element to your page.

The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.

The main element will contain the core content of your page. -->

<!-- Step 8
A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.

Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example:

img {
  width: max(250px, 25vw);
}
In this example, img elements will have a minimum width of 250px. And as the viewport grows, the image will grow accordingly to be 25 percent of the viewport width.

Scale the image using its id as a selector, and setting the width to be the maximum of 100px or 18vw. -->

<!-- Step 15
To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.

Give each of the section elements the region role. -->


<!-- Step 16
Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute. -->

<!-- Step 20
It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.

This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input. -->

<!-- Step 21
Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and name attribute. Then, give the first input a placeholder attribute. -->

<!-- Step 22
Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input. -->
